# terraform-provider-firestore — Agent and Copilot Instructions

## Ways to Fail

Every change to this provider must be checked against the following failure modes. Any new feature or behavior must extend this list with how that feature can fail.

1. **State drift** — Terraform shows a diff after a clean apply with no user changes. Computed attributes such as `update_time` must use `UseStateForUnknown()`.
2. **Data loss on update** — PATCH requests without `updateMask` silently delete Firestore fields not in the Terraform config. All updates must include `updateMask.fieldPaths`.
3. **Silent type corruption** — JSON numbers decoded as `float64` lose precision beyond 2^53. Use `json.Decoder.UseNumber()` and `strconv.ParseInt`. Parse errors must surface as diagnostics, not be discarded.
4. **Missing input validation** — Invalid operator or direction values must be rejected at plan time, not at API call time. Use `stringvalidator.OneOf(...)` in the schema. The `fields` attribute must be validated as a JSON object at plan time.
5. **No retry on transient failure** — A single 429, 500, 502, or 503 must not cause permanent failure. All HTTP calls go through `doHTTPRequest`, which retries with exponential backoff up to 4 attempts.
6. **Test protocol mismatch** — Tests must use `ProtoV6ProviderFactories` with `providerserver.NewProtocol6WithError`. Tests must use `ConfigStateChecks` with `statecheck.ExpectKnownValue` and `tfjsonpath`, not the legacy `Check` field.
7. **Unchecked I/O errors** — `io.ReadAll` errors must be checked. All HTTP I/O goes through `doHTTPRequest`, which handles and surfaces these errors.
8. **State removal on transient error** — `Read()` must only call `resp.State.RemoveResource(ctx)` on a confirmed 404. Any other error status must add an error diagnostic and leave state unchanged.
9. **No schema version** — `SchemaVersion` must be set on the resource. Schema changes without a version increment and a matching `StateUpgraders` entry will corrupt existing `.tfstate` files.
10. **Unvalidated API response format** — `doHTTPRequest` validates that 200 responses carry `Content-Type: application/json`. HTML error pages must never be stored as field data.
11. **Silent partial configuration** — If `impersonate_service_account` is set without explicit credentials, `Configure()` emits a warning. If `project` cannot be resolved, `Configure()` emits an error and stops.

## Consistency Requirements

- Every code change must be checked against all eleven failure modes before it is committed.
- Every test must be traceable to at least one failure mode. The test name or comment must identify which failure mode it covers.
- Unit tests use `go test ./internal/provider/... -run TestUnit` (no `TF_ACC`).
- Acceptance tests require `TF_ACC=1`, `GOOGLE_PROJECT`, and `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
- All changes must compile and pass `go vet ./...` before commit.

## Adding Features

When adding a feature:
1. Identify which failure modes apply to the new feature.
2. Add entries to this list for any new ways the feature can fail.
3. Write tests that cover each new failure mode before writing the implementation (regression-first workflow).
4. Update `go.mod` and run `go mod tidy` if new dependencies are introduced.
